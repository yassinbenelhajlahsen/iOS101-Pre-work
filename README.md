## App Brainstorming 

A button that allows the user to choose their own color
Allow users to change the information displayed and add images
Create an image for the app icon in the home page.

An app I would like to improve is my school's student app, and make it more UI and mobile-friendly. It gets very glitchy and is outdated, so it would be good to see it redone. 


## Notes

The connection wasn't working with the button and ViewController. I found out I created my file incorrectly and redid it. I also needed to delete old connections correctly.
Learned why GitHub is important and how to use it.
